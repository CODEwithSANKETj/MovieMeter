# React + Vite

This is an React + Vite app
1 - To Start the App - npm run dev
2 - All the url and the API key are direclty saved in the app i  have not put it into any .env file as it will get ignored
3 - Main Page is showing the TOP popular show currently , clicking on it you will get to see a model with extra details and movie trailer.
4 - Search bar on top right  , you can able to search movies , click on then wll also only the same model.
5 - For sorting purpose as there are very few options there to sort the movie from the API , i have added Sort by populatiry and other is sort by Release date.
6 -Thats all from my side Thank you
